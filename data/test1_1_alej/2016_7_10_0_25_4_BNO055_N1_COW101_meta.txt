	Where A_x is the accelerometer's magnitude in signed short format (16-bit) in the X direction. A_y is the accelerometer's magnitude in signed short format in the Y direction. A_z is the accelerometer's magnitude in signed short format in the Z direction. A_x, A_y, and A_z are raw data points and can be converted to m/s^2 by dividng them by 100. M_x, M_y, and M_z are the magnetometer values for the X, Y, and Z direction, respectively. They are also in signed short format. M_x, M_y, and M_z are raw data points and can be converted to uT by dividing them by 16. G_x, G_y, and G_z are the gyroscope values for the X, Y, and Z direction, respectively. They are also in signed short format. G_x, G_y, and G_z are raw data points and can be converted to Dps by dividing them by 16. They can also be converted to Rps by dividing them by 900. t is the time that the data point was taken in seconds, from the epoch. It is a double precision float. (64-bit) Each data point consists of these 9 values plus a timestamp, sequentially written to file. !@#

CSV Header:

All the accelerometer values are in m/s^2.
All magnetometer values are in microteslas.
All gyroscope values are in degrees per second.
The time is in seconds, subtracting off the startTime.
