	Where V_a is the voltage on channel 3 of the ADC in signed short format. (16-bit) This voltage represents the voltage coming off of the GSR sensor. V_b is the votlage coming off of the first ECG on channel 2. It is also in signed short format. V_c is the voltage coming off of the second ECG on channel 1. Cannel 0 is unused. t is the time that the data point was taken in seconds, from the epoch. It is a double precision float. (64-bit) Each data point consists of these 3 voltages and a timestamp, sequentially written to file. !@#
