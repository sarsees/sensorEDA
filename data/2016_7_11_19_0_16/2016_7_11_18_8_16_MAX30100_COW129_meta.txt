	Where IR is the MAX30100's infared count expressed as an unsigned short. (16-bit) RED is the MAX30100's RED count expressed as an unsigned short. T is the MAX30100's temperature expressed as a 32-bit float. The value is in degrees C. t is the time that the data point was taken in seconds, from the epoch. It is a double precision float. (64-bit) Each data point consists of this 3 value plus a timestamp, sequentially written to file.
